YOU MUST KEEP MY PROJECT’S ORIGINAL UI/UX 100% SAME.
DO NOT change my theme, colors, layout, animations, images, or component structure.
Replit should NOT redesign anything. Only FIX the project.

📌 TASK FOR REPLIT AI:

I have imported my existing portfolio project from GitHub.
Replit AI changed my UI/UX, theme, design, colors, and removed my photo.
I DO NOT WANT THAT.

I need you to:

✅ 1. Restore My Original Design (Very Important)

Keep my exact theme, burgundy color scheme, rain background, UI, spacing, animations, and photo.

Bring back all original files exactly as in my GitHub version.

DO NOT modify styles, Tailwind classes, assets, or animations unless a bug requires it.

✅ 2. Remove Only Useless Files

Delete ONLY:

Scratch files

Temporary .md files that are not used by the website

Duplicate configs

Backup files generated by Cursor AI

DO NOT remove:

src/components

src/sections

Layout.jsx

index.html

tailwind, vite config

assets folder

my image

styles

animations

nav logic

framer motion animations

✅ 3. Add Missing Files Back

Re-create or restore any necessary missing files such as:

/api/contact.js or backend folder

environment variable templates

assets missing from the design

components that were accidentally removed

Everything must match my GitHub version.

✅ 4. Fix the Contact Form (Frontend Only Version)

Since this is a pure React + Vite frontend:

Modify ONLY the contact form logic to use Formspree or Web3Forms (no backend needed).

Use this endpoint:

POST https://api.web3forms.com/submit

Required fields:

name

email

message

access_key

Use this key placeholder:
access_key: "YOUR_WEB3FORMS_KEY"

Show popup: “Message sent successfully!”

No backend, no 404 errors, no Node server required.

✅ 5. Keep Everything Working

Ensure:

Build works

No console errors

No broken routes

No layout changes

No color/theme changes

No removed components

No UI redesign at all

✅ 6. Output Required

After fixing:

Tell me which files were removed

Tell me which files were restored or created

Tell me if any lines were changed

Show me the final file tree

IMPORTANT:

I want the EXACT original UI of my portfolio from GitHub.
Do NOT override or replace my design.
Only restore, repair, and add missing contact form logic.

⭐ FINAL LINE

Do NOT redesign anything.
Just fix missing files, keep everything same, and make contact form work using Web3Forms.
